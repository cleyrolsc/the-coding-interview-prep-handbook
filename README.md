The Coding Interview Prep Handbook üöÄ
This repository is my personal journey through The Coding Interview Prep Handbook, where I combine theory from the book with practical problem-solving on LeetCode. My goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, with all solutions implemented in Go.

üìò Progress & Core Concepts
I have worked through several key chapters, focusing on foundational concepts and techniques.

Chapters 7-8: Arrays & Strings

Learned to analyze time and space complexity with Big O notation.

Practiced core problems to strengthen problem-solving skills.

Chapters 9-14: Linked Lists, Two Pointers, Stacks & Queues

Deepened my understanding of fundamental data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

Applied key algorithmic techniques such as the Two-Pointer Technique and Sliding Windows to solve problems efficiently.

‚úÖ Completed LeetCode Problems
All problems are implemented in Go and are tied to the concepts covered in the book.

Arrays & Strings

Group Anagrams

Word Pattern

Is Subsequence

Next Greater Element I

Relative Ranks

Distribute Candies

Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String

Maximum Number of Balloons

Linked Lists, Two Pointers, Stacks & Queues

Swap Nodes in Pairs

Rotate List

Linked List Cycle

Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Reverse String

Reverse String II

üìö Roadmap
My plan is to continue this journey by:

Finishing The Coding Interview Prep Handbook.

Solving more LeetCode problems related to each chapter.

Expanding to more advanced topics:

HashMaps & Sets

Trees & Graphs

Dynamic Programming

Tracking my progress and documenting solutions here.

üí° Why this repo?
To track my progress as I study.

To create a reference of solved problems in Go.

To stay consistent by mixing theory and practice.

‚ö° Tech Stack
Language: Go (Golang)
