# The Coding Interview Prep Handbook 🚀

This repository is my personal journey through **The Coding Interview Prep Handbook**, where I’m combining reading, theory, and practice.  
I’ve been working through chapters 1–8 of the book:

- 📘 **Chapter 7 – Big O Notation**  
  Learned how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
  
- 📘 **Chapter 8 – Arrays & Strings**  
  Practiced core problems involving arrays and strings to strengthen problem-solving foundations.

My plan is to **finish the book** while applying the concepts to **LeetCode problems**. This repo documents the problems I’ve solved in Go.

## ✅ Completed LeetCode Problems

All problems are implemented in Go and are tied to the concepts in Chapters 7 & 8.

- [49. Group Anagrams](./completed/49_group-anagrams.go)
- [290. Word Pattern](./completed/290_word-pattern.go)
- [392. Is Subsequence](./completed/392_is_subsequence.go)
- [496. Next Greater Element I](./completed/496_next_greater_element_I.go)
- [506. Relative Ranks](./completed/506_relative_ranks.go)
- [575. Distribute Candies](./completed/575_distribute_candies.go)
- [744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](./completed/744_find_smallest_letter_greater_than_target.go)
- [1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String](./completed/1047_remove_all_adjacent_duplicates_in_string.go)
- [1189. Maximum Number of Balloons](./completed/1189_maximum_number_of_balloons.go)

## 📚 Roadmap

1. Finish reading **The Coding Interview Prep Handbook**.  
2. Solve LeetCode problems related to each chapter.  
3. Expand to more advanced topics:
   - HashMaps & Sets
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks & Queues
   - Trees & Graphs
   - Dynamic Programming
4. Track progress here in this repo.

## 💡 Why this repo?

- To **track my progress** as I study.  
- To create a reference of solved problems in Go.  
- To stay consistent by mixing **theory (book)** and **practice (LeetCode)**.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (Golang)  
- **Problems:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)  
- **Book:** *The Coding Interview Prep Handbook*  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Continue with the next chapters in the book.  
- Add solutions for more problem types.  
- Review and optimize existing solutions with Big O in mind.
